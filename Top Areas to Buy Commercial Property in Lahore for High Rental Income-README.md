## How to Maximize Rental Income from Commercial Property?

Buying property is just the first step. Here’s how you can maximize rental income:

Areas with heavy traffic like Gulberg, Johar Town, and Ferozepur Road often command higher rents due to visibility and customer flow.

### 2\. Consider Plot Size and Frontage

Larger plots with visible frontage tend to attract premium tenants and higher rents. Smaller plots can still deliver great income when located in busy markets.

### 3\. Build for Demand

Know your target market—retail shops, offices, or eateries—and build accordingly. Modern finishes and amenities can justify higher rents.

### 4\. Flexible Payment Options

Investors often find better deals when developers offer installment plans. This reduces upfront capital and improves cash flow while waiting for rental income to start.

### 5\. Stay Updated on Infrastructure Projects

New roads, transit lines, or residential developments nearby can significantly boost property values and rental demand.
